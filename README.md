# PokeResearch

Dependencies: Axios, Bulma CSS

A pokemon reasearch app to look-up the stats of all our favorite Pokemon. Search through any generation in the Pokemon universe! I built this application mostly to practice vanilla javascript, but I did quite enjoy seeing all my favorite pokemon again.
