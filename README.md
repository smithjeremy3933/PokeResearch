# PokeResearch

Dependencies: Axios, Bulma CSS

A pokemon reasearch app to look-up the stats of all our favorite Pokemon. Search through any generation in the Pokemon universe! I built this application mostly to practice vanilla javascript, but I did quite enjoy seeing all my favorite pokemon again.

# To Test

1. Copy the path from the PokeRearch respritory.

2. git clone -path.

3. Open the index.HTML file in your prefered browser and try picking a generation.

4. Begin researching your favorite Pokemon by typing in the input to begin searching through the Pokemon generation data.
